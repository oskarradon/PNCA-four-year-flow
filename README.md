# PNCA Four Year Flow Diagram

### Introduction

This is an animated version of the four year flow diagram from the PNCA guidebook. It is animated using the Greensock animation library.

This project is a part of my workstudy internship in the PNCA Communications office.


### Description

The CSS uses the BEM naming convention for elements. All of the class names are prefixed with `flow__` since this Flow Diagram is a module on a larger page. IDs are not used. More information on BEM can be found [here](http://getbem.com/naming/).
